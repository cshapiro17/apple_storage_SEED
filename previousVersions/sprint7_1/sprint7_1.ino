  This code allows for the automated control of 6 controlled atmosphere rooms at VRS. It 
  utilizes CO2 and O2 sensors to make calculated decisions about controlling the 
  atmospheric conditions in each of the rooms. The code runs on an Arduino Giga R1 Wifi
  which has an STM32 with an M4 and M7 dual core.
